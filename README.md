So I didnt really have time to finish the application properly. but here's the pseudocode:

I need to make a click handler that uses the fischer-yates algorithm and then increment a click counter so that when they click on a different id it adds both to the score and their high score, but if they click on the wrong one, I will make an alert that says too bad next time, and resets the click counter to 0.
